    <h1>Hayk Project</h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Develop an application that serves as a shell with functionalities to process input data, including English words, their IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) transcriptions, and additional information. This application will be versatile, supporting various operations to aid users in learning English. People will be able to install the project on their local servers.</p>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>This application will be developed and released in a step-by-step manner, with each phase representing a fully complete module. The document will be updated every time a new addition is made to the application.</p>
    <h2>Base of Application</h2>
    <p>The website www.blackpilledgeek.io needs a homepage detailing the company's activities. In the same vein, Hayk requires a homepage that outlines the application's functionality and objectives. Additionally, the website should incorporate a user system to enable progress tracking and facilitate the storage of words and images for English learning purposes.</p>
